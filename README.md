# Rusty Befunge

This is a small interpreter written in Rust for the 2-dimensional stack-based esoteric programming language [Befunge](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge). In particular, it is based on the [original Befunge-93 specification](https://catseye.tc/view/Befunge-93/doc/Befunge-93.markdown). The executable expects a single argument, which is the path to the source file.

## Sample programs

Several sample befunge programs are included in the `samples` folder, taken directly from the Esolang wiki.
